# BookManager

## Solution description

BookManager is a PoC solution for managing a simple home library.

* `BookManager`: .NET Standard 2.0 library to handle business logic. Books information is retrieved from [openlibrary](https://github.com/internetarchive/openlibrary).

* `BookManager.Api`: .NET Core 2.2 WebApi that allows accessing `BookManager` functionality through REST controllers. This is the app you'd like to run to test the code (`dotnet build` and `dotnet run` is enough!).
.NET Core 2.2 SDK is required to compile this project (as well as tests projects).

## Swagger documentation generation

REST APIs OpenApi specification is automatically generated on build and copied to `AutoGeneratedFilesBySwagger` dir using [Swashbuckle.AspNetCore](https://github.com/domaindrivendev/Swashbuckle.AspNetCore).

When `BookManager.Api` project is running, API documentation can be accessed in <project_uri>/swagger/index.html (https://localhost:8003/swagger/index.html by default, configurable in `appsettings.json` file or through environment variables.

That page can be used to test the api as well.
